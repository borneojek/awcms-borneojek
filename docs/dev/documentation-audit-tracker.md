### Baseline Evidence Refresh

| Surface | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Node runtime in CI | `.github/workflows/ci-pr.yml` and `ci-push.yml` use `NODE_VERSION: '22.12.0'` |
| Core package engines | `awcms`, `awcms-public`, `awcms-public/primary`, `awcms-public/smandapbun` specify `>=22.12.0` |
| Docs link validation | `awcms`: `npm run docs:check` passes |
| Migration parity | `scripts/verify_supabase_migration_consistency.sh` passes (`99` mirrored migration files, local history aligned) |
| Migration roots | `supabase/migrations/*.sql` = `99`, `awcms/supabase/migrations/*.sql` = `99` |

### Context7 Verification Log (Phase 0 Preflight)

| Library ID | Query Focus | Takeaway |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/supabase/cli` | local vs linked migration workflow and push safety | Keep docs explicit on `migration list --local\|--linked`, `db push --dry-run`, and repair workflow |
| `/withastro/docs` | static route generation and build-time data with `getStaticPaths` | Keep public docs build-time tenant resolution explicit; avoid runtime-only assumptions in static mode |
| `/vitejs/vite` | `loadEnv` behavior and `VITE_` exposure model | Preserve `VITE_` client exposure rules; use `loadEnv` in config-time scenarios |

### Drift Register (Current Cycle)

| ID | Severity | Finding | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REAUDIT-001 | High | `docs/README.md` contained broad conceptual sections not consistently evidence-linked to implementation/module docs | Resolved (Phase 1) | `docs/README.md`, `DOCS_INDEX.md`, `README.md`, `SYSTEM_MODEL.md` |
| REAUDIT-002 | Medium | No maintained package README exists for `awcms-public/smandapbun`, creating a documentation gap for that workspace | Resolved (Phase 4) | `awcms-public/smandapbun/README.md`, `awcms-public/README.md`, README inventory |
| REAUDIT-003 | Medium | Context7 matrix in plan included 12 libraries, but Phase 0 preflight re-validated only 3; remaining libraries needed verification pass | Resolved (Phase 2) | Context7 verification log (Phase 0 + Phase 2), `docs/dev/documentation-audit-plan.md` |
| REAUDIT-004 | Medium | Authority docs stated Node `>=22.12.0` baseline, but `awcms-mcp/package.json` did not declare `engines.node`; enforcement was implicit, not manifest-based | Resolved (Phase 3) | `awcms-mcp/package.json`, `docs/dev/ci-cd.md`, `.github/workflows/ci-pr.yml`, `.github/workflows/ci-push.yml` |
| REAUDIT-005 | Low | Repository has 104 markdown files, including `.agents` skill references and issue templates not yet classified by ownership/status in current cycle tracker | Resolved (Phase 4) | `rg --files -g "*.md" .agents`, `rg --files -g "*.md" .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`, classification notes in Phase 4 update |

## Phase 1 Update (Current Cycle)

### Scope Executed (Phase 1)

- Reconciled Tier 0 authority docs against current repository truth sources.
- Normalized Context7 Astro library ID references to `withastro/docs` across authority surfaces.
- Aligned security/key terminology to prioritize `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` server-side usage wording.
- Reworked `docs/README.md` into an implementation-backed hub that routes to canonical docs instead of conceptual guidance.

### Files Updated (Phase 1)

- `SYSTEM_MODEL.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `DOCS_INDEX.md`
- `docs/README.md`

### Phase 1 Exit Check

- `docs/README.md` now functions as documentation routing hub with evidence-source guidance.

## Phase 2 Update (Current Cycle)

### Scope Executed (Phase 2)

- Reconciled tenancy, security, and database docs against active migration evidence.
- Normalized privileged access wording to `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` server-side usage.

| `/supabase/supabase` | multi-tenant RLS policy design | Keep RLS as hard boundary with tenant-scoped predicates and security definer helpers |
| `/supabase/supabase-js` | client init/auth/session best practices | Keep PKCE, session persistence, and scoped headers patterns in docs |
| `/remix-run/react-router` | route params/loaders data safety | Keep dynamic params + loader patterns explicit in admin/public docs |
| `/websites/react_dev` | React 19 component patterns | Preserve function component-first guidance and targeted optimization notes |
| `/websites/tailwindcss` | Tailwind v4 tokens and CSS variables | Keep docs aligned to CSS-variable token strategy and utility-first usage |
| `/puckeditor/puck` | render and external data patterns | Keep `Render`-based safe rendering guidance and component config references |
| `/ueberdosis/tiptap-docs` | output/persistence and content handling | Keep JSON/HTML persistence guidance and sanitization boundaries explicit |
| `/grx7/framer-motion` | motion configuration and reduced motion | Keep animation guidance focused on performance and accessibility defaults |
| `/openclaw/openclaw` | multi-agent routing and secure gateway baseline | Keep per-tenant isolation and token/loopback security guidance in gateway docs |

### Phase 2 Exit Check

- Tenancy/security/database docs now reference migration-backed helper function sources.
- Service-role terminology in active docs is normalized to `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` server-only paths.

- Aligned package runtime enforcement by adding Node engine constraint to `awcms-mcp/package.json`.

### Files Updated (Phase 3)

- `docs/dev/ci-cd.md`
- `awcms-mcp/package.json`

### Evidence Snapshot (Phase 3)

- `scripts/verify_supabase_function_consistency.sh` -> passes (root/mirror function parity).
- `npx supabase migration list --local` -> executes successfully from repo root.
- `npx supabase db lint` (in `awcms/supabase`) -> executes with known advisory warnings and CI-compatible behavior.
- `.github/workflows/ci-pr.yml` and `.github/workflows/ci-push.yml` remain pinned to Node `22.12.0`.

### Phase 3 Exit Check

- CI/CD and deploy runbooks now use valid, reproducible command paths.

- Completed package/module markdown quality pass for maintained README surfaces.

### Metadata Markdown Classification (Ownership/Status)

| Surface | Count | Classification | Ownership | Status in Current Cycle |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| `.agents/**/*.md` | 35 | Agent runtime skill/reference docs (non-canonical for product behavior) | AI tooling maintainers | Indexed as auxiliary; excluded from authority/module doc correctness gates |
| `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**/*.md` | 2 | Contribution templates (process docs) | Repository maintainers | Indexed as process docs; excluded from implementation truth-source reconciliation |

## 3) Baseline Evidence Snapshot

### Runtime and Tooling Baseline

| Surface | Current Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Node engines (`awcms`, `awcms-public/primary`, `awcms-public`, `awcms-public/smandapbun`) | `>=22.12.0` |
| Admin core stack | React 19.2.4, Vite 7.2.7, Tailwind 4.1.18, Supabase JS 2.93.3 |
| Public core stack | Astro 5.17.1, React 19.2.4, Tailwind 4.1.18, Supabase JS 2.93.3 |
| MCP package | `awcms-mcp` (TypeScript + MCP SDK) |
| CI Node pin | `.github/workflows/ci-pr.yml`, `.github/workflows/ci-push.yml`, `.github/workflows/docs-link-check.yml` pinned to Node `22.12.0` |

### Supabase Baseline

- Dual migration trees detected and currently mirrored:
  - `supabase/migrations/**`
  - `awcms/supabase/migrations/**`
- Local migration history is aligned in both roots through:
  - `20260226110000_fix_sync_resource_tags_article_tags_reference.sql`
- `supabase db lint` runs successfully from both roots (existing advisory warnings remain outside documentation scope).

### Docs Validation Baseline

- Link validation command passes:
  - `awcms`: `npm run docs:check`

## 4) Context7 Verification Log (Phase 0)

| Library ID | Query Focus | Baseline Takeaway |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/supabase/cli` | migration/lint/push/pull workflow | Keep docs explicit about `--local` vs `--linked` and linked-project assumptions |
| `/withastro/docs` | `define:vars` and `is:inline` behavior | Astro docs should explicitly note implied inline behavior on script directives |
| `/vitejs/vite` | `loadEnv` and env exposure rules | Docs must preserve `VITE_` client exposure rule and `loadEnv` guidance in config |

## 5) Drift Register

| ID | Severity | Finding | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DRIFT-001 | High | CI runtime pinned to Node 20 while package engines and authority docs require `>=22.12.0` | Resolved (Phase 1) | `.github/workflows/ci-pr.yml`, `.github/workflows/ci-push.yml`, `.github/workflows/docs-link-check.yml`, `SYSTEM_MODEL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `awcms/package.json` |
| DRIFT-002 | High | Package READMEs still advertise Node 20+ prerequisites | Resolved (Phase 1) | `awcms/README.md`, `awcms-public/primary/README.md` |
| DRIFT-003 | High | Dual migration roots increase risk of documentation ambiguity if canonical source is not explicit | Resolved (Phase 2) | `supabase/migrations/**`, `awcms/supabase/migrations/**`, `docs/tenancy/supabase.md`, `docs/architecture/database.md`, `docs/security/overview.md` |
| DRIFT-004 | Medium | Stitch integration plan contains stale unchecked tasks for migrations already present | Resolved (Phase 2) | `docs/dev/stitch-integration-plan.md`, `docs/RESOURCE_MAP.md`, migrations in both Supabase roots |
| DRIFT-005 | Medium | Legacy `*_ANON_KEY` terminology remains in CI docs, conflicting with current key naming direction | Resolved (Phase 1) | `docs/dev/ci-cd.md`, `AGENTS.md` |
| DRIFT-006 | Medium | Large number of checklist-style pending docs may blur what is backlog vs implemented behavior | Partially resolved (Phase 2 + Phase 4) | `docs/README.md`, `docs/dev/admin-public-db-driven-checklist.md`, `docs/compliance/indonesia.md`, `docs/dev/versioning.md`, `docs/dev/stitch-integration-plan.md` |
| DRIFT-007 | Medium | Mobile/ESP32 package docs used legacy `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` terminology inconsistent with current key naming | Resolved (Phase 4) | `awcms-mobile/primary/README.md`, `awcms-esp32/primary/README.md`, `awcms-esp32/primary/.env.example` |
| DRIFT-008 | Low | `awcms-mobile-java` package README used incorrect relative links to root documentation | Resolved (Phase 4) | `awcms-mobile-java/README.md` |

## 6) Remaining Backlog (Post-Phase 4)

### Priority A

1. Complete checklist status classification pass for remaining checklist-heavy docs outside current reconciled set.

### Priority B

1. Reclassify checklist-heavy docs into:
    - implementation truth,
    - roadmap/backlog,
    so readers do not confuse planned and shipped behavior.
