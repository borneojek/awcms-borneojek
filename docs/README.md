## Overview

**AWCMS Monorepo** provides a unified workspace for building and operating a modern CMS platform:

- **Admin panel** for tenant administrators and platform operators
- **Public portal** for tenant websites / landing pages (Astro + React)
- **Mobile client** (Flutter)
- **IoT client** (ESP32 firmware)
- **Extensions** to add modular features
- **Supabase** backend: Postgres + RLS policies + Edge Functions + migrations

### What “enterprise-grade” implies (practical interpretation)

In this repo context, “enterprise-grade” usually implies:

1. **Tenant isolation** (data separation and least-privilege)
2. **Policy-driven access** (ABAC + RLS)
3. **Auditable operations** (logs, traceability)
4. **Modularity** (extensions + templates)
5. **Operational readiness** (CI/CD, env management, predictable deployments)

## Core Concepts

### Multi-tenancy

Multi-tenancy means **one platform serves many tenants** (organizations, schools, agencies, businesses), each isolated by `tenant_id`.

Common patterns you’ll see (or want to enforce) in an AWCMS-style system:

- Every tenant-scoped table includes `tenant_id`
- Auth/session includes `tenant_id` context (selected tenant)
- Policies prevent cross-tenant reads/writes
- Shared/global tables use `tenant_id IS NULL` or separate schemas

**Implementation baseline (recommended):**

- Enforce `tenant_id` NOT NULL for tenant tables
- Index `(tenant_id, id)` for high-cardinality access
- Use **Supabase RLS** as the final enforcement layer

### ABAC + RLS

**ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)**: access decisions depend on attributes such as:

- subject attributes: user role, staff_level, employment status
- object attributes: tenant_id, module_id, resource classification
- environment attributes: time, IP range, device trust
- action attributes: read/create/update/delete/approve

**RLS (Row Level Security)**: Postgres policies that restrict which rows a user can select/insert/update/delete.

**Common combined approach:**

1. Frontend checks (UX convenience)
2. API/Edge Function checks (business logic)
3. Database RLS (hard security boundary)

**Practical example (conceptual):**

- A user can edit a page **only if**:

  - the page is in the same `tenant_id`, and
  - the user has a policy attribute like `can_edit_pages = true`, and
  - (optional) the page is not “locked” by workflow state

### Audit Log

“Audit-log” topic suggests the platform aims to record:

- who did what (user_id)
- when (timestamp)
- on which tenant (tenant_id)
- against what resource (table, row id)
- before/after changes (diff or snapshot)

**Recommended audit log minimum:**

- INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE tracked for sensitive tables
- workflow events tracked (approve/reject/publish)
- authentication events tracked (login/logout/token refresh)

### Workflow Engine

A “workflow-engine” topic typically indicates:

- draft → review → approve → publish
- role-based approvals (staff levels)
- state machine: allowed transitions

**Simple workflow state machine example:**

- `DRAFT` → `IN_REVIEW` → `APPROVED` → `PUBLISHED`
- `IN_REVIEW` → `REJECTED` → `DRAFT`

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Recommended baseline tooling:

- Node.js 20 LTS + npm/pnpm
- Git
- Supabase CLI (for local DB + migrations)
- Docker (optional but helpful for local Supabase)
- Flutter SDK (for `awcms-mobile/primary`)
- PlatformIO (for `awcms-esp32/primary`)

### Quick Start (baseline)

The README points to a **Developer Setup Guide** and per-client guides. If you’re starting without reading those yet, this baseline workflow usually works:

1. **Clone**

   - `git clone <repo>`
2. **Admin app**

   - `cd awcms`
   - `npm install`
   - configure env (Supabase URL + publishable key)
   - `npm run dev`
3. **Public portal**

   - `cd awcms-public/primary`
   - `npm install`
   - configure env (tenant slug, publishable keys)
   - `npm run dev`
4. **Local Supabase** *(if supported by repo)*

   - `supabase start`
    - apply migrations / seed

## Apps & Packages

### Admin Panel (`awcms/`)

**Purpose:** Tenant administration + platform administration.

**Stack:** React 19.2.4 + Vite 7.2.7 + Supabase.

Typical capabilities you’d expect in an admin panel for a multi-tenant CMS:

- Tenant management (create/activate/config)
- User & role management
- Permissions and ABAC policy editor
- Content modules (pages, posts, media)
- Plugin/extension registry
- Logs & audit views
- Localization (multi-language)
- Theme management (light/dark)

**Recommended admin UX standards:**

- Consistent layout grid (sidebar/header/footer)
- Searchable navigation
- Role-aware menu rendering
- Defensive empty states and error boundaries

### Public Portal (`awcms-public/primary/`)

**Purpose:** Tenant-facing website template(s).

**Stack:** Astro 5.17.1 (static output) + React 19.2.4.

Typical structure:

- Tenant slug routing (build-time generated paths)
- Content fetched from Supabase (public views)
- Static generation with React islands
- SEO primitives (meta, sitemap, OpenGraph)

### Mobile App (`awcms-mobile/primary/`)

**Purpose:** Mobile-first access to tenant content, dashboards, or operational workflows.

**Stack:** Flutter.

Common use cases:

- staff dashboards
- approvals/review workflows
- offline-friendly forms
- push notifications (if configured)

### IoT Firmware (`awcms-esp32/primary/`)

**Purpose:** ESP32-based device integration.

**Stack:** ESP32 + PlatformIO.

Common patterns:

- provision device → associate with tenant
- publish telemetry to an endpoint
- receive configuration updates

### Extensions (`awcms-ext/`)

**Purpose:** Modular external features.

**Stack:** JavaScript modules.

Recommended extension contract:

- manifest (name/version/permissions)
- capability declaration (what the plugin can do)
- safe sandbox boundaries (no direct DB secrets)

### MCP Integration (`awcms-mcp/`)

**Purpose:** Typically used to integrate AI tooling via **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

Likely responsibilities:

- provide structured “tools” for the CMS
- controlled read/write operations
- policy-aware data retrieval

> Keep this layer locked down: MCP tools must not bypass ABAC/RLS boundaries.

---

## Backend (Supabase)

The `supabase/` directory is the home for:

- **SQL migrations** (schema, policies, seed data via `seed_*` migrations)
- **Edge Functions** (API-like server logic)

**Recommended backend structure (if not already):**

- `supabase/migrations/` — schema changes
- `supabase/functions/` — edge functions
- Seed data is currently handled via timestamped `seed_*` migrations in `supabase/migrations/`

### Database design baseline

For multi-tenant CMS + ABAC, typical core tables:

- `tenants`
- `users` (or mapped from Supabase auth)
- `roles`, `permissions`, `policies`
- `resources` (pages, posts, media)
- `audit_logs`
- `workflow_states`, `workflow_events`

### RLS baseline rules

- deny-by-default
- allow only within same `tenant_id`
- enforce “action” rules (update vs read)

---

## Security Practices

### Minimum hardening checklist

1. **Enable RLS on all tenant tables**
2. **No client-side secrets** (use publishable keys only on web clients)
3. **Edge Functions for privileged operations**
4. **Audit trails** for admin and approval actions
5. **Content sanitization** (XSS defenses)
6. **Rate-limiting** on public endpoints (Cloudflare/Supabase)

### Mapping to common standards (optional but useful)

If you want AWCMS to be “compliance-friendly,” a practical mapping:

- ISO/IEC 27001/27002: access control, logging, change management
- ISO/IEC 27005: risk assessment for tenant isolation
- ISO/IEC 27017/27018: cloud + privacy controls
- ISO/IEC 27701: privacy information management
- ISO/IEC 22301: continuity (backup/restore, DR)
- ISO/IEC 20000: service management (incident/change)
- ISO/IEC 27034: application security lifecycle
- ISO/IEC 15408 (Common Criteria): security target thinking for critical modules

> Add these mappings only where you can evidence controls in code + ops.

### Indonesian regulation notes (optional)

For deployments serving Indonesian institutions:

- Align data protection practices to **UU PDP (Law No. 27/2022)** principles.
- For electronic systems, consider **PP 71/2019** (PSTE).
- For government deployments, ensure governance and security baselines match agency requirements.

---

## Deployment Patterns

Common deployment options for this stack:

- **Admin (React/Vite):** static hosting + API via Supabase (Cloudflare Pages is a natural fit)
- **Public (Astro):** static/hybrid hosting (Cloudflare Pages / similar)
- **Supabase:** managed or self-hosted (if governance requires)
- **Mobile (Flutter):** Play Store / internal distribution
- **ESP32:** OTA update pipeline (optional)

### Environment management baseline

Keep separate environments:

- `dev` (local)
- `staging`
- `prod`

And separate Supabase projects per environment.

## Contributing & Governance

The repository includes:

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- `SECURITY.md`
- `LICENSE`

**Recommended contribution flow:**

1. Create a branch per feature/fix
2. Add tests (where applicable)
3. Update docs in `docs/` and `DOCS_INDEX.md`
4. Submit PR with clear scope and screenshots for UI

---

## Troubleshooting

### 1) Supabase keys are set but auth fails

- Verify you’re using the **publishable key** in web clients
- Ensure redirect URLs are set in Supabase auth settings
- Check RLS policies for `auth.uid()` behavior

### 2) Cross-tenant data appears (critical)

- Confirm every tenant table has `tenant_id`
- Confirm RLS policies always filter `tenant_id`
- Remove any **secret key** usage from the client

### 3) Build fails on React 19 / Vite 7.x

- Verify Node 20 LTS
- Ensure dependencies support React 19
- Replace outdated UI libs (slideshow, etc.) if incompatible

### 4) Public portal pages not found

- Verify tenant slug routing rules
- Confirm content exists and is “published”
- Confirm public views or policies allow reads

### 5) ESP32 cannot connect

- Confirm Wi‑Fi creds/provisioning
- Confirm API endpoint and TLS settings
- Add device-level auth token and rotate periodically
