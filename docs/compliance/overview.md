# Compliance Mapping

## Purpose

Map AWCMS security controls to common compliance frameworks.

## Audience

- Compliance reviewers
- Security and platform teams

## Prerequisites

- [SYSTEM_MODEL.md](../../SYSTEM_MODEL.md) - **Primary authority** for compliance controls and data integrity
- [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) - Implementation patterns and Context7 references
- `docs/security/overview.md`

## Core Concepts

- Tenant isolation, ABAC, and RLS are core controls.
- Audit logs provide traceability for critical actions.
- Soft delete is used for data lifecycle control.
- Public analytics uses consent notices and tenant-scoped telemetry tables.
- IP addresses, user agents, and referrers are treated as personal data and should follow retention policies.
- Admin-only profile metadata is encrypted at rest in `user_profile_admin` using pgcrypto.

## Security and Compliance Notes

- Compliance requirements must be validated against your hosting configuration.
- Supabase region selection affects data residency.
- Define retention policies for `analytics_events` if IP data is collected.
